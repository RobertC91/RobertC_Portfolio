				<p>
					Hello, I am Robert Coulson. Since I was young I have always had a fascination for technology, from assembling parts from an old   Packard Bell setup I found around the house, up until I took apart my Xbox 360 and rebuilt it when it malfunctioned with the Red Ring of Death. Although I have driven 18 wheelers for the past 11 years due to necessity, I have been wanting to make a jump into my true passion, technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through the years on the road I have developed a level of   patience and attention to detail that has made me very focused and a bit of a perfectionist. I don't believe in producing sub-par work if it's in my ability to do so, and I always strive to learn and adapt to any situation so that I can produce the best results possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am excited to begin a new chapter in my life and continue to learn and perfect my skills as a Software Engineer. In the future I would like to branch into game development and possibly even pursue AI technology as it becomes increasingly more prevalent in our lives. Thank you for taking time to learn a bit about me and what I do.
				</p>
